# zero-crossing_granulator
Faust implementation of zero-crossing-synchronous rectangular windowing for continuous streams of non-overlapping sonic fragments. The main characteristic of the study is to provide a multi-modal system that, depending on the parameters, can operate as a click-free looper, wavetable oscillator, or granulator.
